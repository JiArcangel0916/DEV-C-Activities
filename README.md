# DEV-C-Activities
Albrecht Zildjian A. Arcangel | Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila


Uploaded are my first year activities in **C programming language** using the **Dev-C++** IDE along with my other practice programs uploaded to free up space in my computer and for other references since I have no other use for the IDE and the corresponding files at the moment. To install the IDE, go to Dev-C++'s website (https://www.bloodshed.net/) and proceed doing your thing.
